# Task_1 Movie Genre Classification
So with the help of python using SVM I  created  a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.Which predicted movie genre with an accuracy of 56.74%

# Task_3 CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
So with the help of python I  created  a machine learning model that can predict customer churn for a subscription-
based service or business. Use historical customer data, includingfeatures like usage behavior and customer demographics.I predicted it using two machine learning algorithms random tree classifer and logistic regression .Random Forest Classifer predicted churn for a subscription with an accuracy of 77.84% and Logistic Regression algorithm predicted with an accuracy of 65.08%
# Task_4 SPAM SMS DETECTION
So with the help of python using naivebias I  created  a machine learning model that canclassify SMS messages as spam or
legitimate.Which predicted the legitimacy of message with an accuracy of 97.57 %
